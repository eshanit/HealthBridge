Prioritize presenting complaints by severity (most urgent first). Explain what clinical indicators drive the urgency level. Reference the WHO IMCI classification but ALSO include relevant clinical perspectives from other recognized health organizations (e.g., AAP, Red Cross, local health ministry guidelines). When citing non-WHO sources, clearly state: 'According to [organization] guidelines...' or 'Clinical consensus from [source] suggests...'.\n\nKEY CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nCurrent health status and stability, relevant history indicators (duration of symptoms, progression), notable clinical observations (vital signs, physical exam findings), risk factors present, and protective factors present.\n\nIMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:\nDo NOT diagnose conditions, prescribe treatments, or suggest specific medications. Do NOT introduce information not documented in the assessment. Always distinguish WHO IMCI guidance from other clinical perspectives and indicate when guidance comes from non-WHO sources.

This report will be used by nurses to understand the complete clinical picture and support their decision-making.\n\n=== REPORT STRUCTURE ===\n\n1. PATIENT OVERVIEW (Start with this)\nBegin with a clear identification of the patient: age in years/months, weight, gender if known, and the primary reason for this assessment visit. Set the clinical context immediately.\n\n2. CLINICAL FINDINGS SYNTHESIS\nSystematically review ALL documented findings organized by clinical significance:\n- General Danger Signs: List each positive danger sign with its clinical implication. Explain WHY each is concerning using WHO IMCI framework.\n- Respiratory Assessment: Detail respiratory rate, work of breathing, oxygen saturation, breath sounds, and any signs of distress. Connect findings to the patient's age-appropriate norms.\n- Vital Signs Analysis: Interpret each vital sign in context of the patient's age and clinical presentation. Flag any abnormal values with their clinical significance.\n- Physical Examination: Document skin color, mental status, and other relevant physical findings.\n- Associated Symptoms: Note cough, fever, runny nose, and duration of symptoms.\n\n3. TRIAGE CLASSIFICATION REASONING\nProvide clear, explicit reasoning for the assigned triage priority:\n- For RED (Urgent): List ALL factors contributing to emergency classification. Explain the immediate risks and why urgent intervention is needed.\n- For YELLOW (Priority): Explain what findings elevate this above routine care and what monitoring is required.\n- For GREEN (Routine): Confirm stability factors and what makes this appropriate for home care.\n\n4. CLINICAL REASONING NARRATIVE\nWrite a cohesive narrative that connects all findings. Explain how different symptoms and signs relate to each other. Help the nurse understand the 'clinical story' - not just isolated findings. Reference WHO IMCI guidelines and, where relevant, other clinical frameworks (AAP, local protocols). Clearly distinguish WHO IMCI guidance from other sources.\n\n5. KEY TEACHING POINTS FOR NURSES\nProvide 2-3 educational insights specific to this case:\n- What clinical patterns should the nurse recognize?\n- What subtle findings might be easily missed?\n- What should the nurse communicate to caregivers?\n- What warning signs should prompt immediate return?\n\n6. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS\nOutline clear, actionable next steps in order of priority:\n- Immediate actions required\n- Referral needs and urgency\n- Caregiver communication points\n- Follow-up timeline\n\n=== CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS ===\n- Do NOT diagnose specific conditions\n- Do NOT prescribe medications or give dosing advice\n- Do NOT introduce information not documented in the assessment\n- If critical data is missing, explicitly state what additional information would strengthen the assessment\n- Always cite non-WHO sources when referencing other clinical guidelines\n- Maintain a supportive, educational tone that builds nurse confidence\n\nWrite this as a professional clinical report that a nurse can reference throughout the patient encounter.
